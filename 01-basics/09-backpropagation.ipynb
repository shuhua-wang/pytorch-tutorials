    "\n",
    "**Chian rule** is a formula to compute the derivative of a composite function. If a variable $z$ depends on the variable $y$, $z=f(y)$, where the $y$ itself depends on the variable $x$, $y=f(x)$. The derivative of $z$ with respect to $x$ can be calculated by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x}=\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial y} \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x}$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Computational graph and local gradients\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/computational_graph.png\" alt=\"computational_graph\" width=\"400\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "**A computational graph** is defined as a directed graph where the nodes correspond to mathematical operations. Computational graphs are a way of expressing and evaluating a mathematical expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we assume that the $z$ is a function of variables $x$ and $y$, $z=f(x,y)=xy$. The $Loss$ is a function of $z$, $Loss=f(z)$. Assume that we have already known the derivative of $Loss$ with respect to $z$ is equal to $\\frac{\\partial Loss}{\\partial z}$, how can we calculate the derivative of $Loss$ with respect to $x$?\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we can obtain the **local gradients** (the derivative of $z$ with respect to $x$ or $y$):\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x}=\\frac{\\partial xy}{\\partial x}=y$, $\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial y}=\\frac{\\partial xy}{\\partial y}=x$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, based on the **chian rule**, the derivative of $Loss$ with respect to $x$ is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{\\partial Loss}{\\partial x}=\\frac{\\partial Loss}{\\partial z} \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x}=y\\frac{\\partial Loss}{\\partial z}$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Forward and backward pass\n",
    "\n",
    "The backpropagation consists of 3 steps:\n",
    " - (1) forward pass: compute loss;\n",
    " - (2) compute local gradients;\n",
    " - (3) backward pass: compute dLoss/dWeights using the chain rule\n",
    "\n",

    "**Linear regression:**\n",
    " - The linear regression is defines as: $y=wx$\n",
    " - The prediction value is represented as: $\\hat{y}$\n",
    " - Error between predicted and real value is: $s=\\hat{y}-y$\n",
    " - Loss function is defined as squared error: $Loss=(\\hat{y}-y)^{2}$\n",
    " - Given an example as: $(x=1, y=2)$, the initial weight: $w=1$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Forward pass:**\n",
    " - $\\hat{y}=wx=1 \\times 1=1$\n",
    " - $s=\\hat{y}-y=1-2=-1$\n",
    " - $Loss=(\\hat{y}-y)^{2}=(-1)^{2}=1$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Local gradients:**\n",
    "  - $\\frac{\\partial Loss}{\\partial s}=\\frac{\\partial s^{2}}{\\partial s}=2s$\n",
    "  - $\\frac{\\partial s}{\\partial \\hat{y}}=\\frac{\\partial (\\hat{y}-y)}{\\partial \\hat{y}}=1$\n",
    "  - $\\frac{\\partial \\hat{y}}{\\partial w}=\\frac{\\partial wx}{\\partial w}=x$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Backward pass:** using the chian rule to compute dLoss/dWeights\n",
    " - $\\frac{\\partial Loss}{\\partial w}=\\frac{\\partial Loss}{\\partial s} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial s}{\\partial \\hat{y}} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial \\hat{y}}{\\partial w}=2sx=2 \\times (-1) \\times 1=-2$"
