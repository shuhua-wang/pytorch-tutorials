    "**Chian rule** is a formula to compute the derivative of a composite function. If a variable $z$ depends on the variable $y$, $z=f(y)$, where the $y$ itself depends on the variable $x$, $y=f(x)$. The derivative of $z$ with respect to $x$ can be calculated by:\n",

    "$\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x}=\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial y} \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x}$\n",

    "\n",
    "**A computational graph** is defined as a directed graph where the nodes correspond to mathematical operations. Computational graphs are a way of expressing and evaluating a mathematical expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we assume that the $z$ is a function of variables $x$ and $y$, $z=f(x,y)=xy$. The $Loss$ is a function of $z$, $Loss=f(z)$. Assume that we have already known the derivative of $Loss$ with respect to $z$ is equal to $\\frac{\\partial Loss}{\\partial z}$, how can we calculate the derivative of $Loss$ with respect to $x$?\n",

    "First, we can obtain the **local gradients** (the derivative of $z$ with respect to $x$ or $y$):\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x}=\\frac{\\partial xy}{\\partial x}=y$, $\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial y}=\\frac{\\partial xy}{\\partial y}=x$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, based on the **chian rule**, the derivative of $Loss$ with respect to $x$ is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{\\partial Loss}{\\partial x}=\\frac{\\partial Loss}{\\partial z} \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x}=y\\frac{\\partial Loss}{\\partial z}$\n",
